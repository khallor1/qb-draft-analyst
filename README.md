# qb-draft-analyst
CIS192 Final Project

Methodology:
Since the purpose of this project is to predict the performace of draft prospects the the quarterback position, I will look at all of the quarterbacks drafted into the NFL from 2010-2017.  I will then scrape their college football stats to use as my inputs to the training data and their nfl performace as the uotput to the training data.  The test data will be current college QBs.

Features for prediction (career, or year-by-year?). how to hange grad transfers?:
Conf G Cmp Att Yds TD Int (ht/weight/size?)

Outputs:
nfl stats of some sort-maybe classify in a similar manner to the stanford paper
